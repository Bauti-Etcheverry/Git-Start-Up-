It's useful to keep synchronized code between different people(coworkers).



We upload oner version of the code online on a repository. This allows to all the coworkers to access 
to that code and if any make of them makes changes to the code, it is uploaded and the repository keeps the latest
and most updeated version of the code.

Git also give us the opportunity to revert back to old versions of the code.
